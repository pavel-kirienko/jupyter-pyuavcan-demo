# Jupyter PyUAVCAN demo

[![Forum](https://img.shields.io/discourse/https/forum.uavcan.org/users.svg)](https://forum.uavcan.org)

A Jupyter notebook showcasing how to use PyUAVCAN for interactive network analysis.

Usage instructions:

1. [Install PyUAVCAN](https://pyuavcan.readthedocs.io).
2. [Install Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
3. Open the notebook: `jupyter notebook pyuavcan.ipynb`.

As a better alternative to the web browser, consider using [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
It is a wonderful IDE (rumor has it that it's better than VSCode) and it has a solid support for Jupyter notebooks
out of the box.

If you have a clever snippet to share, add it to the notebook and send a pull request at once!
